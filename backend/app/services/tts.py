"""Text-to-speech service — converts LLM summary text to spoken audio.

Uses Groq's Orpheus v1 English TTS model (canopylabs/orpheus-v1-english)
via the OpenAI-compatible speech endpoint. Returns raw WAV bytes which the
caller base64-encodes and sends to Electron for playback.

Orpheus is a high-quality neural TTS model that runs on Groq's infrastructure.
It supports six voices and outputs WAV format only.

    """Convert text to speech using Groq Orpheus and return base64 WAV.

    Calls ``canopylabs/orpheus-v1-english`` with the resolved Orpheus voice
    name. The caller should resolve the user's ``voice_gender`` preference to
    a concrete voice name via ``VOICE_GENDER_MAP`` before calling this function.
    Falls back to ``settings.tts_voice`` if no voice is supplied.

    The response is raw WAV bytes which are base64-encoded for safe embedding
    in a JSON response body. The caller attaches the result to
    ``QueryResponse.speech_b64`` so Electron can decode and play it without a
    second round-trip.

    Args:
        text: The text to synthesise — typically the LLM ``summary`` string
              from the vision pipeline (≤ ~200 chars for best latency).
        voice: Concrete Orpheus voice name (e.g. ``"autumn"``, ``"daniel"``).
               Defaults to ``settings.tts_voice`` when ``None``.

    Returns:
        A tuple of ``(speech_b64, elapsed_ms)`` where ``speech_b64`` is a
        base64-encoded WAV string and ``elapsed_ms`` is the round-trip time.
        Returns ``("", elapsed_ms)`` on any failure so the query route can
        still return beacon steps even if TTS fails.

    Raises:
        Does not raise — all exceptions are caught and logged. The empty
        string sentinel lets the caller degrade gracefully.
