    action, takes a screenshot, and calls /agent/turn.

    Attributes:
        action: Type of interaction to perform.

        w: Fractional width of bounding box.
        h: Fractional height of bounding box.
        text: Text to type — only when ``action == "type"``.
        keys: Keyboard shortcut — only when ``action == "key"``
              (e.g. ``"Ctrl+S"``, ``"Alt+F4"``).
        direction: Scroll direction — only when ``action == "scroll"``.
